# 2048 Game using Python.

This 2048 Game was made using Python. We used Tkinter for the GUI, and custom logic for the inside game.

# Start of the game:
At the start of the game two '2's are displayed on two random tiles on the grid. The window also displays a button for playing musi in the background.
